# Power BI Data Insights Project

## Overview
This project uses a dataset derived from a comprehensive survey data professionals took. The survey provided extensive detail in its responses, covering key aspects of the data industry such as salaries, job satisfaction, programming preferences, work-life balance, and more.

## Purpose
The objective of this Power BI visualization was to explore and present intriguing insights from high-level questions, such as:
- Salary differences across roles
- Preferred programming languages in the workplace
- Job satisfaction factors, including pay and work-life balance

Additionally, the visualizations can be cross-analyzed to uncover deeper insights, from comparing pay differences in specific roles across regions (e.g. India) to analyzing work-life balance satisfaction differences between genders.

## Data Preparation
Basic data cleaning was performed using Power Query to ensure data clarity and accuracy. 

## Future Enhancements
With my foundational skills in Excel, SQL, and Python demonstrated in previous projects, future iterations of this project will focus on:
- Advanced data cleaning and transformation techniques to optimise the dataset
- Creating more detailed visualizations for nuanced data interpretations 

## Conclusion
This Power BI project showcases essential data analysis skills and visualization techniques to present insights for decision-making. As the project develops, I aim to enhance data cleaning and create increasingly insightful visualizations.
